            <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> The Software integrates the ChatGPT artificial intelligence system to provide automated responses to text-based inputs.

            <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for evaluating the responses generated by the AI and for taking appropriate actions based on the content.
