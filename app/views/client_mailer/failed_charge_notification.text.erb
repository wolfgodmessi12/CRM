Hi <%= @client.def_user.firstname %>,

We were unable to process your last payment of <%= number_to_currency(params[:amount]) %> for <%= params[:charge_reason] %>.

<%- if params[:content].present? -%>
<%= params[:content] %>
<%- end -%>

Please take a moment to double-check your payment information to make sure your CHIIRP account keeps running smoothly.

Why did the payment fail?

In most cases, a payment might fail because:

- The card expired
- There are insufficient funds
- The payment needs additional authentication before we can process it.

We'll try charging your card again in 1 day and let you know if the payment is successful.

If you have any questions or need our help, you can reach our support team at 801-753-9312 or just reply to this email.

Thanks,
